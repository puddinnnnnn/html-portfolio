<p>I'm Ralph De Guzman, graduate of Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at La Consolacion University Philippines. 
  Dreaming of becoming a skilled Full-Stack Web Developer. I have a hobby of playing computer games and consoles. Aside from my indoor hobbies, I am also athletic and 
  really love playing Basketball since i was a child, on my 2nd Grade of Elementary to be specific when i first learned how to play Basketball.

<p> 
  I am also currently working on Geodata Solutions Inc. since 2021 as a QAD/ System Implementer. In my current role as a QAD/ System Implementer at GeoData Solutions Inc., I have successfully managed
  system installations, provided technical support to users, and resolved technical issues to maintain
  operational efficiency.

  Being inspired and motivated to become a skilled Full-Stack Web Developer is the reason why I want to learn and study Web development for a better career and future.
